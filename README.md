# TheBattle

"In battle, he is as if possessed by a demon." 

This game is made out of respect for one of my favorite games of all time. It is based on a battle in Metal Gear Solid, when Snake first encounters Vulcan Raven in a tank. All characters, quotes, themes, etc. belong to Konami Digital Entertainment.

This is a small turn based battle, similar to the Pokemon style battle system, where a human player and computer oponent are initialized with random stats. The human player can select one of three attacks, and the computer player will randomly select one of three possible attacks. The possible attacks and accuracy (defined as a successful attack vs. a miss) depend on the randomly-generated initialized stats, which also change as the battle progresses. Hit points are decremented, and the first player to reach <= 0 hit points loses the battle.
